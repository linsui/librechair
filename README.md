this is a port of Q AOSP Launcher3 that doesn't crash when not the system quickstep provider.
this is based on a patch made by @paphonb that allows it to compile correctly in Android Studio
apologies for not crediting him in the first place
this is *not* the baisis of Q librechair, but rather something I decided to put up here.

all modifications to Launcher3 made by me are licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or any later version.
